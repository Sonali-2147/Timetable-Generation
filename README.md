# School Timetable Generator 📚

Welcome to the **School Timetable Generator**! This project simplifies the process of creating school timetables, ensuring that every minute of the school day is perfectly organized for students, teachers, and administrators. 🎓✨

## 🌟 About the Project

Every school requires a reliable timetable that balances classes, breaks, activities, and meets all constraints. This project automates the creation of timetables for **Jr. Kg**, **Sr. Kg**, and **1st Standard** students across divisions **A**, **B**, **C**, and **D**.

The system ensures that:
- Every subject is assigned to the appropriate teacher.
- School-specific rules (such as start/end times, period durations, and lunch/assembly breaks) are adhered to.

With this tool, we can efficiently generate timetables that meet all requirements.

## 🎯 Goals

- **Automated timetable generation** for all classes and divisions.
- Adherence to school-specific rules, including:
  - Start/End times
  - Period durations
  - Lunch and assembly timings
- Mapping of subjects to the appropriate teachers.
- Providing a **reproducible and user-friendly** solution for timetable generation.
