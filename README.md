# Timetable-Generation
🕒 School Timetable Generator 📚
Welcome to the School Timetable Generator! This project simplifies the tedious process of creating school timetables, ensuring every minute of the day is perfectly organized for students, teachers, and administrators. 🎓✨

🌟 About the Project
Every school needs a reliable timetable that balances education, breaks, and activities while meeting all constraints. This project takes care of it all for classes Jr.Kg, Sr.Kg, and 1st Standard across divisions A, B, C, and D.

With automation, we ensure every subject is assigned to the right teacher and every constraint is met.

🎯 Goals
Automatically generate timetables for all classes and divisions.
Adhere to school-specific rules like:
Start/End times
Period durations
Lunch and assembly timings
Map subjects to the appropriate teachers.
Provide a reproducible and user-friendly solution.
